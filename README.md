Q1. Mobile app dev. languages and tools

The below languages can be used to develop Mobile Application:

Java:- Firstly Java was the official language for Android App Development (but now it was replaced by Kotlin) and consequently, it is the most used language as well. Many of the apps in the Play Store are built with Java, and it is also the most supported language by Google. In addition to all this, Java has a great online community for support in case of any problems 

 Kotlin:- Now Kotlin is the official language for Android App Development declared by Google in 2019. Kotlin is a cross-platform programming language that may be used as an alternative to Java for Android App Development. It has also introduced as a secondary “official” Java language in 2017. Kotlin can interoperate with Java and it runs on the Java Virtual Machine. 

C++ :- C++ can be used for Android App Development using the Android Native Development Kit(NDK). However, an app cannot be created totally using C++ and the NDK is used to implement parts of the app in C++ native code. This helps in using C++ code libraries for the app as required. 

C# :- C# is quite similar to Java and so it is ideal for Android App Development. Like Java, C# also implements garbage collection so there are fewer chances of memory leaks. And C# also has a cleaner and simpler syntax than Java which makes coding with it comparatively easier. 

Python:- Python can be used for Android App Development even though Android doesn’t support native Python development. This can be done using various tools that convert the Python apps into Android Packages that can run on Android devices. 

HTML, CSS, JavaScript:- Android apps can be created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the Adobe PhoneGap framework that is powered by Apache Cordova. The PhoneGap framework basically allows the usage of web development skills to create hybrid apps that are shown through “WebView” but are packaged like an app.But if you are comfortable with Javascript, you can learn React Native, which is an open-source framework that is now highly in demand. You can develop beautiful and powerful  Hybrid apps.

Dart :- Dart is an open-source programming language that powers the Flutter framework, which is getting a lot of traction these days because of its ability to deliver beautiful and performance apps for the web, desktop, and mobile in lesser time.

Corona:- Corona is a software development kit that can be used for developing Android apps using Lua. It has two operational modes, namely Corona Simulator and Corona Native. The Corona Simulator is used to build apps directly while the Corona Native is used to integrate the Lua code with an Android Studio project to build an app using native features. 

Q2. How Mobile domain is different from the web ?

1.In comparison to desktop Web sites, which usually contain a wide range of content and information, mobile sites usually include only the most crucial and time- and location-specific functions and features.
2.On desktop Web sites, horizontal navigation at the top of a page is a widely accepted way of structuring and presenting a site’s content. However, vertical navigation replaces horizontal navigation on more than 90% of the mobile sites we analyzed.
On desktop Web sites, designers use graphics for many different purposes, including promoting, marketing, and navigating. Mobile sites avoid using promotional and marketing graphics and use minimal graphics for navigation.

Q3. Key differences among the natives, hybrid and Cross platform and how to choose technology.
Native Apps:-
Native apps are built specifically for a particular operating system leveraging platform-specific programming languages.

Native app development is the process to develop apps or software that need to be operated on specific devices and mobile app platforms such as Android and iOS. With native app development, developers rely on the native-to-the-operating-system programming language to craft apps that fit one particular platform- may it be desktops, smart TVs, smartphones, or any other advanced gadgets being used in the digital space.

When it comes to developing native apps for Android, Java or Kotlin are used and in the case of iOS, Objective-C or Swift is used.

Cross-platform:-
Cross-platform vs hybrid app development, both have entirely different meanings from each other and play different roles. Cross-platform frameworks operate on the agenda to develop shareable and reusable code for building apps for different OS. Writing code once and reusing the same on multiple platforms helps in minimizing the development costs and efforts.

Hybrid app:-
Hybrid app development is the combination of native and web solutions where developers need to embed the code written with the languages such as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript into a native app with the help of plugins including Ionic’s Capacitor, Apache Cordova, and so on which enables to get the access of native functionalities.

When it comes to delivering the utmost performance to the users and comparing cross-platform vs hybrid vs native app performance, choosing native mobile app development approach is the wise decision to make. Native Android app development enables you to discover next-gen features of smartphones in a hassle-free manner like memory management, network and wireless access points, and so on for optimizing service delivery and eventually improving the overall app performance.

Q1. What platforms are available for developing mobile apps? 
 The available platforms are:-
 
For Cross Platforms:-
Xamarin
React Native
Flutter
Ionic

For iOS:-
Alpha Anywhere
Mendix
Swiftic
 
For Android:-
Xamarin
PhoneGap
Sencha
Ionic
Kotlin

Q2. Native(Java/Kotlin/Swift/Objective-c) vs Cross Platforms(React-native, Flutter, Cordova, ionic)
 Cross Platforms:-
 Think of cross-platform development as the approach with the "Write Once, Run Everywhere" principle because the process requires only a single reusable codebase but is built to run on multiple mobile platforms and operating systems. The key enabler here is the use of cross-platform mobile app development frameworks such as React Native and Flutter.
 
cross-platform frameworks are created by third-party companies, organizations, and even just by developer communities, there’s some risk that upgrade or further development of these frameworks could be inconsistent, slowed down, or discontinued.
Native platforms:-
Native app development is the process of building an application exclusive to a particular platform. Those that want to deploy their apps across multiple platforms can still do so natively, but deployment in each requires separate — oftentimes parallel — development processes.
Apps natively built on Android and iOS benefit from stability when it comes to maintenance and updates. New features can be implemented immediately upon release.

Q3.Core differences among - React-native, Flutter, Cordova, ionic etc


React Native :- is a cross-platform framework created by Facebook. With a codebase written in JavaScript, React Native makes it fairly simple to create cross-platform applications, lowering the barrier to entry for JavaScript developers.

Flutter:- is a cross-platform UI framework developed by Google. First released in May 2017, Flutter has grown steadily in popularity over the years.

 Flutter uses the Dart programming language in its codebase, whereas React Native uses JSX.
 Both languages are based on the C-style type of syntax and follow object-orientated principles. 
 Flutter’s documentation is easy to read because it is nicely formatted, structured, and detailed. In comparison, React Native’s documentation is not straightforward.

React Native also heavily depends on community-developed dependency libraries, so its documentation is not as well-organized.
JavaScript is dynamic by nature. This means you can change the values of various data types, which makes it very versatile. Dart is both dynamic and static, which allows it to have the best of both worlds.

Flutter uses a widget style for constructing the user interface, whereas React Native uses JavaScript and JSX.
Both Flutter and React Native use CSS Flexbox for constructing layouts. The way each framework implements it is different, 
As such, there is currently higher demand for React Native developers than for Flutter developers. However, that doesn’t mean Flutter is unpopular; in fact, Flutter continues to gain popularity over time.

Both frameworks use hot reloading, making development more efficient since you can instantly see the changes made

onic and Apache Cordova :- 
onic and Apache Cordova are not considered competitors; instead, Ionic is built on top of Cordova. They are two popular technologies widely adopted in the market for mobile app development. The combination of these technologies forms a development platform which is known as hybrid app development. 

Apache Cordova is an open-source framework, which allows web developers to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a native application for different mobile platforms.

Apache Cordova allows developers to access the native features of an application, such as camera, video recording, audio feature, location access, etc. With the Cordova, you can integrate a lot of different plugins in your application to fulfill all the requirement that uses the hardware of a device to run the application.

It has web-based UI running in a web view, due to which it does not provide a good look and feel to the app.
It is not the right technology to develop game application because it requires some higher-end plugins which are currently not available.

Ionic is an open-source UI toolkit for building high-quality Mobile apps, desktop apps, and progressive web apps. It uses web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create high-quality cross-platform apps. It allows developers to build once and run everywhere. It was created by Max Lynch, Ben Sperry, and Adam Bradley and developed by Drifty Co. in 2013. The first version of the Ionic framework introduced in March 2014.

 It is easy to learn and can integrate with other libraries or frameworks such as Angular, React, Cordova, etc. Officially, the Ionic framework has integration with Angular, but it also provides support for Vue.js and React.js.

The ionic application can deploy on multiple platforms such as iOS, Android, Desktop, and the web, all with one codebase. The ionic apps can write once and runs everywhere.
The user interface of Ionic, such as themes and components are highly customizable. The ionic platform allows its components to adapt to the platform on which the application is running.
The app developed with the Ionic framework may not provide as much security as a native application. For example, if you are developing a financial app, e.g., the app for a bank, the Ionic framework is not recommended.

Ionic provides frameworks to use in the application. Whereas Cordova provides plugins to run the application similar to the native app.
The Cordova plugin allows you to make your own plugin, whereas Ionic does not provide you to make your own plugin.

Q4. Why react native and why not? (Pros and Cons).

Easy to work with – experienced developers will definitely appreciate the development experience. Meaningful error messages, time-saving and robust tools make it a premium choice over other platforms.

Works everywhere – Once you learn React Native, you can build apps for iOS and Android and Windows.


Intelligent debugging tools – and error reporting mechanisms. Give it an advantage over others and allows developers to focus more on the productive part.

Easier to debug – uses Flipper as default.
Keep things minimal and worthy – it doesn’t force you to work in Xcode or Android Studio for iOS or Android apps respectively.

A large community of developers – who are contributing day in, day out.

Code reusability – developers can easily integrate 90% of the native framework and reuse the code for any platform. This feature not only saves time but also helps to cut down the cost of building two apps. Cool thing is that you can use the web app code (written in React) for a mobile app.

Pre-developed components – numerous open-source libraries are available to accelerate your work.

Live reloading feature – it helps to compile and read the file from the point where the developer made changes. Then a new file is offered to the stimulator which automatically reads the file from the beginning.


Smoother and faster UI – as compared to classic hybrid ones. React Native apps use native APIs to render their UI.

Expo – it’s a great tool for the fast development of apps for many platforms, with many ready-to-go libraries in the SDK. Check out how to publish Expo React Native App to iOS and Android.

One codebase for all – a possibility of keeping just one codebase to run a project in an Android, iOS and web browser.

Demo mode – when using Expo, it’s possible to build a demo for a customer without actually pushing the app to the Testflight or Google Store. The only thing we need is an Expo App on a mobile device.

Hot reloading – allows developers to see the changes they applied in the code almost immediately, which saves a great amount of time.

REACT NATIVE CONS

Performance is still lower than native – React Native is not able to use all the blessings and potential of a specific platform. On the other hand, a native app can really maximize functionalities and deliver the ultimate user experience in the result.

However, the re-architecture puts a lot of effort to make RN more performant, e.g. there is a new JS engine available – Hermes, and it makes apps running much faster on older Android devices.

Not efficient design-wise – If you consider complicated designs or advanced interactions as a crucial part of your business advantage, you should definitely go for native development.

Custom modules – many custom modules are already available, yet, there may be a need for some specific components that you will be forced to build from scratch yourself.

Updating issues – it’s hard to keep the app updated with the latest React Native version. Updating React Native versions is in most cases a complicated process.



There are 4 threads in the React Native App :

1) UI Thread : Also known as Main Thread. This is used for native android or iOS UI rendering. For example, In android this thread is used for android measure/layout/draw happens.

2) JS Thread : JS thread or Javascript thread is the thread where the logic will run. For e.g., this is the thread where the application’s javascript code is executed, api calls are made, touch events are processed and many other. Updates to native views are batched and sent over to native side at the end of each event loop in the JS thread (and are executed eventually in UI thread).

To maintain good performance, JS thread should be able to send batched updates to UI thread before next frame rendering deadline. For example, iOS display 60 frames per sec and this lead to new frame every 16.67ms. If you do some complex processing in your javascript event loop that leads to UI changes and it takes more than 16.67ms, then UI will appear sluggish.

One exception are the native views that happen completely in UI thread, for example, navigatorIOS or scrollview run completely in UI thread and hence are not blocked due to a slow js thread.

3) Native Modules Thread: Sometimes an app needs access to platform API, and this happens as part of native module thread.

4) Render Thread : Only in Android L (5.0), react native render thread is used to generate actual OpenGL commands used to draw your UI.
